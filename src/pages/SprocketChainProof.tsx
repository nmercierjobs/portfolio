                  My mechanical approach to continuously variable steering gain is to translate a steering arc into a rotation. At stage 1, sprocket A is fixed in place on the head tube to cause the planet sprocket to rotate when the handlebars are turned. This rotation is then transferred to the sun sprocket on the head tube where it can be used to drive the wheel. Varying the distance x to the planet will increase the arc length it rotates through, altering the output rotation. For simplicity, the diagram below does not include the chain tensioner needed to vary the distance.

                  The following is a derivation of the sprocket dimensions required to create the desired gear ratio of 1 to 2. Stage 1 has been simplified to the planet rotating about an internal gear. The chain connecting the planet and sun has also been omitted.

                  Consider the clockwise rotation of the arm through angle α, which effectively rotates the planet through angle α as well. This will then create the clockwise rotation δ of the sun via the connected chain. Similarly, the planet rolls along arc length a and creates the counterclockwise rotation β of the planet and ω of the sun.

                <p className="mt-4">
                  The desired quantity is the ratio of the <em>net</em> rotation of the sun to the rotation of the arm. The fundamental property linking the rotations is the equivalence of the arc lengths. The following relationship expresses the net rotation of the sun in terms of the two arc lengths.

                <EquationImage src={equation1} alt="" widthPercent={EQUATION_WIDTH_PERCENT.netRotation} />
                <p>The arc length a is defined by the radius of the internal sprocket and the angle of the arm. Arc length b is the result of the effective rotation of the planet by the arm.</p>
                <EquationImage src={equation2} alt="" widthPercent={EQUATION_WIDTH_PERCENT.arcLengths} />
                <p>Combining these relationships and simplifying gives the following conclusion. The negative sign indicates that the output is in the opposite direction of the arm.</p>

                <p>
                  Interestingly, a gain of 1 is not possible. To fix this, a gear reduction after the sun gear would be needed. Another concern is whether the mechanism is too long. Using #25 chain, a 10-tooth planet sprocket, and a 25-tooth sun sprocket, the total length would be approximately 3.5 inches. Very reasonable.
