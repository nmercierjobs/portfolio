    summary: "I built a novel sensor capable of measuring height and orientation above the ground in outdoor environments. Similar to how humans perceive depth, a 3D camera uses two different images to construct a model of its surroundings. I use one of these cameras to model the ground which can be used to calculate the sensor’s height and orientation. However, the camera cannot distinguish between the ground, rocks, twigs, and sticks. Using complex algebra, I break the model into small squares and analyze each one to determine whether it belongs to the ground. Removing these obstacles allowed me to achieve millimeter-level accuracy under real-world conditions. Through a variety of program optimizations, I was also able to achieve 90 measurements per second.",

      "To ensure I met the requirements, I began by calculating the overall measurement error with an uncertainty analysis. I found that, of the main methods for measuring distance — time-of-flight, ultrasonic, single-point LiDAR, and radar — only time-of-flight and LiDAR provided the precision I needed. However, I realized that in a real environment, surface variations and obstacles could make any single measurement unreliable. To identify these incorrect measurements, I would need to collect a large number of points.",
      "A 3D camera can measure the positions of thousands of points simultaneously. This provides enough data to distinguish points belonging to the main surface from those caused by obstacles or surface irregularities. There are time-of-flight, LiDAR, and stereo vision 3D cameras to choose from. I initially tested a time-of-flight camera (Pico Flexx) but discovered its performance deteriorates in strong sunlight. LiDAR was rejected for the price, leaving stereo vision as the only option.",

The voxel arrays within each cluster are then concatenated and a histogram of projected heights is formed.

As I delved deeper into analyzing the forces, it became clear that many additional components would be required to guarantee success. And any mistakes in the design or manufacture would be costly and potentially cause the project to exceed its budget. As a result, I transitioned to the steer-by-wire system which trades much of the mechanical complexity for software complexity.",

To determine the required motor size, I reviewed research papers to establish the torque required to turn handlebars. These studies reported a maximum steering torque of 2 N·m. I then used published values for maximum human hand speed and acceleration to estimate the corresponding maximum handlebar angular velocity and acceleration. Combined with the measured fork and wheel inertia, these values were used to calculate the torque required to achieve the desired steering performance. Additional research and calculations were also used to establish design requirements for latency and battery life. All together, I had the following additional requirements to consider.",

How do you match the inertias? With a gearbox! Nowhere is this spectacular property taught, and it’s a crime. A gearbox reduces or increases inertia by the square of the ratio. With a NEMA 24 motor, I managed an inertia ratio of 2.4 using a 20:1 gear reduction. At the planned 1500 rpm max motor operating speed, this exceeded the velocity requirement at 75 rpm. A NEMA 34 motor did not cost much more and could have achieved the ideal inertia ratio, but a cardboard mockup revealed it would be excessively large for the bike." },

This resulted in noticeable wheel lag during large, sharp turns. Correcting this would be straightforward by changing the bevel gear ratio, but the budget had already been exceeded by about $75. More importantly, the design was intended for straight-line driving, where the lag was not noticeable. The input delay requirement was met with a total delay of 15 ms, and using O-rings to provide steering resistance was highly successful.

Adding the ability to zero the encoder was difficult and would occasionally output some bad data. The SG filter was successful in catching this and prevented damage to the bike and user. Using the filtered positional data also eliminated measurement noise, permitting smaller motor increments. This, combined with microstepping, reduced vibrations to an acceptable level.",

Given enough time, I am sure reverse steering could be learned, although I am unsure whether prior bike riding experience is advantageous. Steering gain was more successful and I was surprised by how variable the initial reactions were. With a gain of 2, some people were completely unfazed, while others steered wildly and nearly crashed. Some would even oversteer once, after which it seemed to immediately click. Even those who initially struggled were able to adjust after a few attempts. I was also surprised to find that I enjoyed a gain of 2 far more than conventional steering.

The Durofix had a backlight, the ANPUDS had a color screen, and the remaining models had different screen sizes. Unfortunately, after disassembling them, I discovered that all four used multiplexed displays. Purchasing them was not a waste, however, as I also wanted to characterize the displays’ responsiveness and refresh rates. I assembled a test rig in which I dropped a 1/2-inch socket onto the end of a socket wrench and recorded the displays in slow motion. To identify the start of the impulse, I built a simple circuit that illuminated an LED when the socket contacted the wrench. This proved extremely informative, with the ANPUDS model being substantially more responsive than the others. I later measured its frame rate directly at 60 fps and suspected that the remaining displays operated at 30 fps.",

I did a lot of testing with op amps, diodes, and comparators before realizing I had made a mistake. I assumed that the AC drive voltage requirement meant that the voltage must alternate between a positive and negative voltage. The screen was actually set up to produce an AC voltage between 3.6 V and 0 V. With a DC bias, why isn't the screen damaged? Because the polarity between the common line and segments alternates, creating an average DC voltage of zero. With this, I was able to simplify the circuit using voltage dividers, allowing an analog-to-digital converter (ADC) to sample the waveforms directly. For each of the 32 segments, the segment and its associated common line are sampled independently, and the difference between the two is computed digitally to determine the power status.",

            "At this point, the ideal approach would be to measure the common waveforms to determine when each segment should be sampled. I had access to an oscilloscope at UC Davis, but I wanted to challenge myself to solve the problem without one. Without knowing how the screen was updated, I instead designed my program to continuously sample the segments and calculate their root mean square voltage. This approach, however, reduced the effective sampling rate from 60 Hz to around 20 Hz. Additionally, transitions between certain digits could briefly produce readings corresponding to another valid digit. These corrupted measurements would have been relatively easy to remove during a post-processing step, but I wanted to achieve a faster sampling rate.",
            "Close to abandoning the oscilloscope-less approach, I inspected the microcontroller on the torque adapter and managed to read its model number (BH67F5265). With it, I found thorough documentation of the many LCD drive types it supports. The waveforms generated for each drive type are unique, so I plotted some ADC measurements to determine which one is used by this sensor. The waveform for COM0 is shown below. The full set can be viewed here.",

            "Understanding when the sensor applied updates to the screen was confusing. Based on the documentation, I initially assumed that the beginning of COM0 marked the start of every frame. To avoid measuring the screen during an update, I planned to detect a change, wait for the update to complete, and then resume sampling at the beginning of the next COM0 pulse. This failed. I realized that what I called COM0 was likely not the same signal described in the documentation. I then tried starting each frame at what I called COM1, COM2, and COM3. This also failed. After considerable trial and error, I discovered that a frame could start at the beginning of any of the COM waveforms. Applying this insight, I wait for one frame starting from whichever COM line drives that segment before I resume sampling.",
            "My realization that the circuit could be greatly simplified using only demultiplexers and voltage dividers opened up another opportunity: integrating all of the electronics within the original housing. To accomplish this, I cut off the original AAA battery compartment and powered the sensor directly from the microcontroller. Ordering a custom PCB would have made this far less challenging, but a mistake would have been costly and difficult to correct while also exceeding the project budget. Instead, I chose to use a prototype PCB, which gave me greater flexibility to modify and refine the circuit as I went.",

Alternatively, the demultiplexers could be eliminated entirely since the microcontroller has enough ADC channels to interface with the display directly.

    summary: "Wireless communication is unreliable. Typical radio frequencies such as 2.4 GHz are shared by many devices, making them susceptible to interference. Frequency hopping can be used to improve reliability by periodically changing the transmission frequency. However, effective implementation requires both communicating devices to be synchronized so they can switch to the same frequency at the right time. Matching timers with wireless communication is tricky because any variability in sending or receiving timestamps leads to very poor accuracy. By capturing timestamps at the very end of the transmission process and the very beginning of the reception process, I minimized this variability and achieved an accuracy of 250 nanoseconds.",

Each device uses two timers: one is a counter, and the other is free-running. The free-running timer is set with a somewhat arbitrary wrap point; I am currently using a value of 50,000. The receivers shrink or extend this capture/compare register in order to match the master device. On each overflow, the counter is incremented. To timestamp an event, I leveraged Nordic’s Programmable Peripheral Interconnect (PPI) system. It allows configuring hardware events and tasks to occur without CPU intervention, effectively eliminating timing jitter. With this, I can capture the value of both timers simultaneously and combine them for the complete timestamp." },

During this delay, the timestamp is written to the outgoing packet." },

Therefore, when calculating the offsets, the delays in the transmitter timestamp up to this point must be accounted for.

I measured the latter delay directly with a logic analyzer and found it to be 29.5 microseconds, resulting in a total delay of 39.5 microseconds.

      challenges: [
        "The automatic synchronization requirement created an interesting challenge when synchronizing the counter. If the master device has been powered on for an extended period, its counter count can grow beyond what the receivers can correct. This is because the counter can only be incremented by one or reset to zero. To match the master counter, the receiver must reset its counter, then increment it to match. This process can take longer than the free-running timer’s wraparound period, causing additional increments to occur before synchronization is complete. To address this, I synchronize the counter in two stages. The majority of the counts are incremented in the first stage, except for those guaranteed to be correctable in the second stage.",
        "I chose Nordic’s nRF52 series of microcontrollers for this project because of the company’s strong reputation and its proprietary Enhanced ShockBurst (ESB) radio protocol. However, integrating the protocol with time synchronization proved to be a significant technical challenge. ESB requires exclusive control of the radio peripheral, while time synchronization requires direct, low-level access to the same hardware. To resolve this conflict, I implemented Nordic’s Multiprotocol Service Layer (MPSL) timeslot feature, which temporarily yields control of reserved peripherals. This also simplified correction event scheduling. Initially, achieving the system requirement of microsecond-level accuracy required correction events every few milliseconds because the timers operate at slightly different tick rates. To reduce the frequency of these corrections, I used linear regression to estimate the clock drift rate and apply corrections in between the master correction events. This extended the interval between master corrections from milliseconds to tens of minutes.",
        "ESB presented another challenge. It modifies the default radio settings, causing my timestamps to be ignored by the receiving device. After exploring my options, I determined that I would need to replicate the ESB message format when transmitting the timestamp. I scoured the nRF52 datasheet, which was useful for understanding the standard radio packet format but provided little information about ESB itself. I then turned to the nRF24 series datasheet, which documented the legacy ShockBurst protocol in greater detail, but even this information was insufficient. Ultimately, I had to reverse-engineer the format by tracing through the source code.",
        "Another challenge I encountered was an unusual race condition. The counter would occasionally be one increment too small while the free-running timer read zero. I initially implemented the free-running timer using the Nordic shortcut system, which is essentially a non-configurable version of the PPI system. I eventually discovered that the shortcut system has a shorter propagation delay, causing the free-running timer to reset ever so slightly before the counter could be incremented. Reconfiguring the free-running timer to use the PPI system equalized the propagation delays, resolving the issue.",
      ],
    },
    results: "The final result was an accuracy of 250 ± 21 ns. Exceeding the 1 μs requirement provides the opportunity to further extend the time between correction events. Corrections have currently been tested at 10-minute intervals, with accuracy declining to only 350 ns. Based on these results, maintaining the 1 μs requirement with hourly corrections appears very achievable. Automatic synchronization was also successful, regardless of the power-up order of the devices. In retrospect, was the approach successful? Yes and no. All requirements were exceeded, but implementing the peripheral management and low-level radio control was very time-consuming. In my case, I greatly value what I have learned about the nRF52 hardware and would not change anything. Practically, the RBS protocol should be able to achieve the same results with a fraction of the effort.",
